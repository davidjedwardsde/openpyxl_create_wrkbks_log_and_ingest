# openpyxl_create_wrkbks_log_and_ingest
A script to use openpyxl to create workbooks, log issues and ingest data once populated by sales professionals. 

These scripts were made when I needed a way to create workbooks for over 100 sales professionals to help clean their book of business. The first function was made to create the workbooks. The second function was made to check to see if there were any issues on the workbooks once the sales professionals had populated the data. The third function was made to ingest the data once the issues were cleaned from the result of the second function.
